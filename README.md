# Medical Imaging AI Integration

## Project Description

This project is a web-based or desktop application that allows medical professionals (radiologists, doctors, technicians) to upload medical images—such as X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans—and receive AI-assisted diagnostics and annotations. The system integrates a trained AI model (e.g., a convolutional neural network) that detects anomalies or diseases (e.g., tumors, fractures, pneumonia) and provides visual indicators and probability scores to help doctors make decisions faster and more accurately.

## Key Features

- **Upload and store medical images securely.**
- **Run AI-based analysis on images.**
- **Display results visually (heatmaps, bounding boxes, or labels).**
- **Provide diagnosis suggestions with confidence scores.**
- **Maintain patient history with previous image results.**
- **Multi-user roles: Doctors, Radiologists, Admin.**
- **Option to export or share reports.**
- **Integration with hospital systems (optional stretch goal).**

##  Story Cards (User Stories)

### Doctor User Stories
- **As a doctor, I want to upload a patient's medical image so I can get an AI-based analysis.**
- **As a doctor, I want to see highlighted problem areas (e.g., tumors, fractures) on the image.**
- **As a doctor, I want the AI to give me a diagnosis suggestion with a confidence percentage.**
- **As a doctor, I want to compare AI results with previous scans of the same patient.**
- **As a doctor, I want to download a report of the AI analysis in PDF format.**

### AI Analysis Stories
- **As an AI system, I want to process medical images and identify abnormalities.**
- **As an AI system, I want to display confidence scores for each possible condition.**
- **As an AI system, I want to visually mark areas of interest on the medical image.**

### Image Management Stories
- **As a user, I want to upload JPEG, PNG, or DICOM files.**
- **As a user, I want to view a history of uploaded scans.**
- **As a user, I want to filter scans by date or patient name.**

###  Security & Roles
- **As an admin, I want to manage user roles (doctor, radiologist, admin).**
- **As a user, I want to log in securely using my hospital credentials.**
- **As an admin, I want to ensure all image data is stored securely and encrypted.**

### Reporting & Output
- **As a doctor, I want to receive a diagnostic report that summarizes the AI results.**
- **As a user, I want to export results to PDF or email them to another doctor.**
- **As a doctor, I want the ability to add manual notes to the AI-generated report.**

### Testing & Feedback
- **As a developer, I want to test the AI model against known image datasets.**
- **As a doctor, I want to give feedback on the accuracy of AI suggestions.**
- **As a user, I want to mark AI predictions as “Correct” or “Incorrect” to help improve the system.**

### Optional Stretch Features
- **As a hospital IT admin, I want to integrate the system with the hospital’s EMR (Electronic Medical Records).**
- **As a user, I want the app to support multiple languages.**
- **As an admin, I want analytics on how many scans are processed daily/weekly.**
